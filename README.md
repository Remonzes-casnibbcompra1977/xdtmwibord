Bro, I just walked out of Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness and my brain feels like a scrambled egg left out in the sun. You know how sometimes a movie just grabs you by the collar and shakes you up a bit? Yeah, that's what this was like. 

The theater was so noisy, some dude kept sneezing, but hey, I guess love conquers all, even germs. I'm trying to type but there's popcorn crumbs all over my jeans, and my back's killing me from that stiff chair. That opening scene, though, with the sunflowers—they were like smiling assassins, right? Just standing there, joyfully plotting goodness.

There was this bit where the protagonist was staring at the moon like it owed him money, and it hit me—I remembered I was supposed to download the movie for Sarah, I think. You gotta watch the movie, man. 

> And then, there was this twist, like a raccoon finding a dustbin in the night, just unexpected and weirdly satisfying. It felt like the director just went “bam!” and pulled the rug right from under us. Was it love or destiny or a cosmic joke? Who knows, but my brain can’t stop spinning.

All those colors on the screen were like eating a box of crayons as a kid; confusing but kinda beautiful in their own chaotic way. The dialogue at times was a hamster running on an existential wheel, just round and round, but never getting tired.

And the sound! Like, if honey could sing opera, that's how sweet some of the scenes felt. And then others were like rusty knives scraping against a chalkboard, but maybe that's just art, man. I dunno, I think my wallet fell under the seat, so not downloading a second time, but whatever, all worth it.

I swear, at one point in the movie, I could literally smell cinnamon...? Or maybe it was the perfume of the lady next to me, who kept gasping like a fish.

Here, the exit sign looked like a green alien trying to whisper secrets to us, right as the credits rolled, and I swear every name started to blur together like alphabet soup that's been overcooked. 

I don't even want to process how I feel until I’ve had a burger and possibly some strong advice from Google, but it was like that time we stayed up all night talking about the universe, only this had popcorn.
